## Layout of signatue

The signature in bookbing is a collection of sheets that is an unit of contents.
Book can consists of single signature or multiple signatures. 
For single sheet binding, for example traditional asian binding, you just print double side print your manuscript
and bind them. However, for folded signature, you need to rearrange the pages of the pdf.
The order of the pages depend on the number of sheet per each signature.
