    In working

Unlikely the manuscripts for book, booklet and the others that contains its own contents,
the note is designed for users to fill their own contents.
Notes consist of very few template pages, even a single template.
For single and very simple note template, symmetric to its center, the imposition process is not needed, but
if you design a laboratory note or some complicate template, it is needed.

Some notes need page numbering, expecially laboratory note.
As like note mode, you can disable or enable the numbering routine.
It allows you to set next options.

* Location: Header/Footer
* Align: Left/Center/right
* Count: Even/Odd/Both/Even only/Odd only

The count options may be confuse if you see at first. 
This represent the counted pages and number indicated pages.

Even: count full pages and indicate it only on even pages.
Even(only): count only even pages and indicate it only on even pages.
