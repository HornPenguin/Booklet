    In working

Unlikely the manuscripts for book, booklet and the others that contains its own contents,
the note is designed for users to fill their own contents.
Notes consist of very few template pages, even a single template.
For single and very simple note template, symmetric to its center, the imposition process is not needed, but
if you design a laboratory note or some complicate template, it is needed.
