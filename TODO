Version 0.0.3 - in working

  * Note routine implementation - in working
    * Add header, footter: font, size, color, margin, align
    * font, size
    * page number location
    * total page

    Note Mode : On/Off
    Note Pages: Total number of Note <- Must be a multiple of 4
    Page numbering: 
      None, 
      {[Header, Footer], [HF, FH]}, 
      [Both, ODD(n), ODD(y), EVEN(n), EVEN(y)], 
      {[L ,R ,C], [LR, LL, LC, RR, RL ,RC, CC, CR, CL]}
    Header: None, [Both, Odd, Even], [Align], size, repeat by
    Footer: None, [Both, Odd, Even], [Align], size, repeat by

    * Sub todo: font routines
      * Measure text width of decimal string by font. - in working

  * Support General fold sequences: Very hard job maybe cannot finish it in time.

  * Additional printing markers: Angle mark, Trim line, Bleed Line, Fold line, Direction(top, bottom) indicator
     - Partially done, interface modification is needed for gui and cui 
  
  * Duplex Printing offset: Flip back side and offset(translation), add template for measuring offset at test printing stage.
     - Partially done, Duplex converting module is implemented and Mark is added on PrintingMark module

  * Merge Multiple files at once
  * Progress bar routine update
  * Repeating routine add

  * Rebuild the structure:
    * Multiple PDF routines
      * PyPDF2
      * Borb
      * MuPDF
      * Ghostscript
    * Image to PDF routines
Version 0.0.2 - current

* Unifying Graphic-Console. - Done
* Image convert routine implementation. - Done
* Custom Imposition and rearrange option. - Done
* Extensible and maintainable code clean up. - in working
